<p>I will implement a ray tracing algorithm that uses packet-based traversal techniques and relies of high quality SAH-based bounding volume hierarchies.</p>

<p>Ray Tracing is a technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light through pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. Ray tracing is capable of simulating a wide variety of optical effects, such as reflection and refraction, but at a higher computational cost than other algorithms like rasterization.</p>

<p>Individual light rays are shot from the viewer (the eye, or the pixel ) into the scene. When a ray hits a surface, it can suffer up to three phenomena: reflection (the ray direction is changed so that it returns to the medium from which it originated, for example, for mirrors), refraction (the ray ‘bends’ due to a change in the medium it is traversing ) and or shadow. To further avoid tracing all rays in a scene, a shadow ray is used to test if a surface is visible to a light (trace a direct line to each light source and test intersection with opaque objects in the scene). In case it is, the light contributes to the object’s color and the reflected/refracted ray is recursively traced through the scene, otherwise the object is in shadow for that light source. </p>

<p>Since ray tracing follows the laws of physics, very photo-realistic images can be produced with it and there is increasing interest towards making the algorithm and the building of data structures it uses fast enough to be in interactive and real-time applications.  </p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
